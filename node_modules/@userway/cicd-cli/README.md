### Install @userway/cicd-cli npm package

npm install --save-dev @userway/cicd-cli
```

In order for  UserWay CI/CD CLI  to function properly there are 2 prerequisites:
register at https://cicd.userway.org and import your repository as a project
create userway.config.js file

Configuration of userway.config.js depends on a use case. There are 3 distinct use cases of UserWay CI/CD CLI:
- self hosted accessibility scans
- managed accessibility scans
- combination of the two - into a single use-case

### userway.config.js for self-hosted use case

Once you have installed @userway/cicd-cli package, you will need to create the config file:

```
/** @type {import('@userway/cicd-cli').schema.Config} */
module.exports = {
   organization: 'YOUR-OURGANIZATION-SLUG',
   project: 'YOUR-OURGANIZATION-NAME,
   connection: 'https://google.com',
   pages: [
       { url: '/' }
   ]
};
```

### Run @userway/cicd-cli
```
npx userway -token YOUR-TOKEN-FROM-CICD-USERWAY-ORG
```
