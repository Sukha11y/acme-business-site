@userway/cicd-core is a component of UserWay CI/CD (Continuous Accessibility) infrastructure.
This library encapsulates client-side integration logic with the Continuous Accessibility backend and triggers accessibility analysis.
It glues UserWay CI/CD E2E integrations (like [@userway/a11y-cypress](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@userway/a11y-cypress)) and UserWay CI/CD backend.
The primary function is to collect a11y reports generated during CI/CD pipeline execution and trigger analysis via the UserWay CI/CD API.
@userway/cicd-core exposes API and is used by multiple Continuous Accessibility extensions:

- [UserWay CI/CD CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@userway/cicd-cli)
- [UserWay GitHub action](https://github.com/UserWayOrg/cicd-action)
- [UserWay Bitbucket pipe](https://bitbucket.org/product/features/pipelines/integrations?search=user&p=userway/cicd-bitbucket)
- [UserWay Azure DevOps extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Userway.ContinuousAccessibility)
- [UserWay GitLab Docker Image](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/userway/cicd-gitlab/general)

It is recommended that one of those extensions be used in most cases, but developers can install and use @userway/cicd-core directly to trigger Continuous Accessibility analysis programmatically.

### Installation of @userway/cicd-core npm package
```
npm install --save-dev @userway/cicd-core
